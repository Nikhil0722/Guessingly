I have changed something on main, now I switched to dev and want to match dev too, so what should I do it?
    ->git checkout dev
      git pull origin dev                # update local dev
      git merge main                     # merge changes from main into dev
      git push origin dev                # push the updated dev branch
How to look in git graph:
    ->git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
      * cf5e7a4 (HEAD -> dev, origin/main, origin/dev, main) 2nd test
      * 2b49f90 testing Dev_branch
      * 4322a06 Initial commit
How to push code:
    -> git add .
    -> git commit -m "Write your comment"
    -> git push origin main
